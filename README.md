# Hybrid-Real-Time-Speaker-Diarization
A Hybrid Real-Time Speaker Diarization System that combines offline processing for accuracy with online subsystems for real-time performance
# Hybrid Real-Time Speaker Diarization System

## Description
This project presents a novel Hybrid Real-Time Speaker Diarization System that combines offline processing for accuracy with online subsystems for real-time performance. Our approach leverages Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCCs) for feature extraction, followed by low-rank deep embedding to obtain compact yet informative speaker representations.

## Introduction
Speaker diarization is the process of segmenting and labeling audio data based on speaker identities. This project aims to develop a hybrid system that integrates both offline and online subsystems to achieve continuous and accurate speaker diarization.

## Features
- **Offline Processing**: High accuracy through comprehensive analysis of accumulated data.
- **Online Processing**: Real-time adaptation and speaker labeling with minimal latency.
- **Hybrid Architecture**: Combines the strengths of both offline and online subsystems.

## Installation
To install the necessary dependencies, run the following command:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
